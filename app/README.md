# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Map on Android

The event detail screen shows a map (iOS uses Apple Maps; Android uses Google Maps). For the map to appear on **Android**, set your Google Maps API key in `app.json`: replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_ANDROID_API_KEY` under `expo.android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` with your key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (enable Maps SDK for Android). Rebuild the app after changing the key: `npx expo run:android`.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
